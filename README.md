[My Notes](notes.md)

This application will allow friends to share the random errands that they need to do throughout the week and sends invites to friends to join them! 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

College students hate doing things by themselves. Let be honest though, most people think errands would be more enjoyable if a friend joined them. The ChoreChum application will allow friends to share errands that they have to run and invite others to come along! It will give an option for if something is flexible as well, so that friends can ask for a time change if needed. If a friend chooses to join a certain errand, it will notify the poster so they can reach out with any details.

### Key features

- Secure login for users through HTTPS
- Ability to "post" errands on the calendar for friends to see
- Ability to add descriptions and flexibility to errands
- Display of errands that friends have posted in a calendar view

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for the calendar itself where people can add events, and one to see friends list and add new people. 
- **CSS** - Application styling that is pleasing to the eye and easy to look at. Also adds color coordinating by friend.
- **React** - Provides login, ability to add new events and friends,and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving events from friends
    - choosing to join on an errand
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, events hosted, events joined, and friends list in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't post events unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user hosts an errand, those events are broadcasted to those in friends list.
