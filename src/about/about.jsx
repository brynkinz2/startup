                    would be more enjoyable if a friend joined them. The ChoreChum application allows friends to share

                    is flexible as well, so that friends can ask for a time change if needed. If a friend chooses to
                    join a certain errand, it will notify the person who posted it so they can reach out with any
                    details.</p>
